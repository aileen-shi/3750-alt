                <aside>"A composition is always more than the sum of its parts. In other words, 
                    a really good piece of music is more than itself. It's sort of like a prism, 
                    which you can see from each facet a single totality."<br><br>-Yo-Yo Ma
                </aside>
                <p>The principles of composition are the guidelines for organizing and 
                    arranging elements of design within a piece.

                </header>
                <p>Balance describes the visual weight inside a composition. It is used to
                    create a sense of stability and harmony.

                    <li>Symmetrical: Elements are mirrored around an axis</li>
                    <li>Asymmetrical: Elements are not mirrored and vary in sizes, shapes, 
                        and colors.
                    </li>
                    <li>Radial: Elements are arranged around a central point radiating outwards.</li>

                    <h3>Rhythm</h3>

                <div class="visual">

                <figcaption>Example of types of rhythm</figcaption>
                </div>
                <p>Rhythm uses elements repeatedly in a way that creates motion similar to music. Types of 
                    rhythm include regular rhythm which is consistent, alternating rhythm which alternates
                    between multiple elements, and progressive rhythm which gradually changes elements as they
                    repeat.

                    <h3>Emphasis</h3>
                </header>
                <p>Emphasis helps to create the focal point of a work. The focal point is the area that grabs 
                    your attention first. You can emphasize your focal point through contrast, placement, or 
                    size and scale.

                    <h3>Contrast</h3>
                </header>
                <div class="visual">
                    <img src="contrast.jpg" alt="contrast">
                    <figcaption>Example of types of contrast</figcaption>
                </div>
                <p>Contrast uses differing elements to draw your attention. For example, you can 
                    use contrasting colors to make elements stand out against each other. You can 
                    also use different shapes or forms to create contrast. Textures and patterns
                    like something shiny vs something dull will also create contrast.

                    <h3>Repetition</h3>
                </header>
                <p>Repetition repeats elements to create a sense of unity. Repetition is like rhythm without
                    the different patterns.

                    <h3>Proportion</h3>
                </header>
                <p>Proportion is the size and scale of elements in relation to each other in a composition.
                    Scale is the size in relation. Hierarchy is the order of importance of elements. Usually 
                    elements are seen as more important than smaller ones.
