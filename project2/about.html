        <h3>Intro</h3>
        <p>
          The PokemonTCG API contains a database of Pokemon cards that include
          base set through Sword & Shield. You can access different cards that
          include details about that card as well as an image. You can also
          access sets to see what series it belongs to and how many cards were
          printed. The API is free to use.
