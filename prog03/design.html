                <p>Elements of design are the components that are used to design visual compositions.
                    They form the building blocks of many projects that span across many creative 
                    fields like web design or painting. Understanding these elements and their interactions
                    helps to produce more aesthetic and cohesive designs.
                    <br><br>    
                    Being able to understand these elements help designers to become more efficient 
                    with communicating their ideas through visuals. This page will provide an overview of
                    each element.

                    <h3>Line</h3>
                </header>
                <p>A line is a continuous mark that connects 2 points. You can use lines to direct
                    the viewer's eyes.
                </p>
                <h4>Types of Lines:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Straight</li>
                    <li>Curved</li>
                    <li>Zigzag</li>
                    <li>Dotted</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Lines could also be literal such as a telephone line. They can also be implied and come
                    from the borders of different colors, patterns, or even from motion.

                </header>
                <p>
                    Shape is a 2-dimensional area surrounded by an outline. 
                </p>
                <h4>Types of Shapes:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Organic - Seen in nature</li>
                    <li>Geometric - Angular and mathematic</li>
                    <li>Abstract - Representational of things in nature </li>

                    <h3>Color</h3>
                </header>
                <p>Color is very important for creating the mood or tone of a piece. 
                    Color has different properties: hue, brightness/chroma, and value.
                    Hue is the name of the color. Brightness is the intensity or saturation.
                    Value is how light or dark it is.

                    <h3>Texture</h3>
                </header>
                <p>Texture is how you would describe something if you could touch it. 
                    You can have physical texture in something like a sculpture that 
                    uses metal or another real material. You could also have optical texture 
                    which involves creating the illusion of texture through something like
                    a painting or a photograph.

                    <h3>Value</h3>
                </header>
                <p>Value is how light or dark something is. White would be the highest value
                    while black would be the lowest. Different colors will also have different 
                    values. Value is important for creating contrast.
                </p>

                    <h3>Form</h3>
                </header>
                <p>Imagine form as the upgraded version of shape. Forms are 3-Dimensional objects
                    like a sphere or a cube. Forms include volume, length, width, and height. Forms
                    can be used to create the illusion that you are look at something with depth
                    or dimension.

                    <h3>Space</h3>
                </header>
                <p>Space is the area found between different elements. Positive space is filled
                    with more elements while negative space is empty. Balanced use of space helps 
                    to make sure that designs don't feel cluttered or noisy. Space can be used to
                    highlight important elements and create harmony.
