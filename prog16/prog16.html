            <h2>Results of User Test</h3>
                <h3>The User</h3>
                <p>The user is a grad student. She spends 4-5 hours a week on the internet.
                    She usually uses a phone and computer.
                </p>
                <h3>Initial Thoughts</h3>
                <p>The user thinks the page looks barren and needs graphics.</p>
                <h3>Task 1: Pull up a Lechonk card</h3>
                <p>The user took 28.18 seconds to complete. The task was described as simple
                    with nothing being notably confusing. The user wishes there was more pictures
                    or thumbnails for the cards instead of ID.
                </p>
                <h3>Task 2: Navigate to the About Page</h3>
                <p>The user took 48.43 seconds. They got lost and used the navbar to go to Home because
                    they assumed About and Home were the same. She said she was thrown off by
                    API because she doesn't know what that is. The task could have been worded better 
                    to go to the API About page.
                </p>
                <h3>Task 3: Navigate to the API Official Documentation Link</h3>
                <p>The user took 7.95 seconds. She found the link from the previous task.</p>
