                <p>Perspective is used to represent 3-dimensional objects in a 2-dimensional
                    space. You can use it to create the illusion of depth for the viewer.

                    <p>The horizon line is where you are eye level. It is the point where the sky meets 
                        the ground and you cannot see past it. A higher horizon line makes it feel
                        like you are looking down. A lower horizon line will feel like you are looking up.

                        line. Everything gets smaller as it recedes into the distance and they 
                        will appear to merge into a vanishing point.

                    <p>One-point perspective is when you look at something straight on. There 
                        will only be one vanishing point. Anything facing directly towards 
                        will have the bottom and side edges be vertical and horizontal. Edges on 
                        the side will point towards the vanishing point.

                    <p>Two-point perspective has 2 vanishing points on the horizon. You will be 
                        facing the corner of something rather than face on. Edges on the left 
                        will point towards the left vanishing point and vice versa for the right.
